***How To Play***
------------------
Different dice are used depending on the time a task takes. Generally, tasks that take less than ten minutes use the d6 system, and tasks that take longer use the d10 system. 

### D6s
D6s are used for determining quick, rapidly resolved situations. When attacking someone, quickly patching someone up, or climbing a cliff, d6s are used to provide the result. If someone is skilled at that action, more d6s are used and less are used if that person is bad at said action. Circumstantial bonuses or penalties can also be applied, adding or subtracting dice in turn. If only one d6 is available, roll that d6 the required number of times.

D6 rolls (initiator) are compared against a competing value (receiver). This value can either be a static goal or a variable goal with it's own quantity of d6s rolled against. The value over the goal is used for damage, how successful an action was, etc.

Higher values beat lower values. Ties go to the initiator. 

If an initiator rolls below five (5), the roll is a critical failure unless the goal value is met or exceeded. 

Basics of how many dice are used:
- 3 d6 base
- For every +2 in the relevant stat, add 1d6
- If trained in task, add 2 d6
- item bonuses
- Circumstantial bonuses/penalties are given for major impacting elements like being blinded or an enemy having superior knowledge on a coversation topic.

### D10s
D10s are used for tasks that take time, coversations and damage. Depending on the difficulty and scale of the task, the required value may be acheivable in one roll or it might require several perfect rolls to succeed. 

#### Tasks
D10 rolls are used in conjution with an appropriate skill when creating something or completeing a task. The value is determined by rolling 2 d10s (one declared beforehand as the tens place) or with the percentile and the d10. After the roll, a skill modifer is applied based on the skill of the person performing the task. Being trained in a task adds a skill level, E.G. an average painter that's been trained gets the intermediate bonus

| Skill value | Label | Modifier |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| -2 | Hopeless | -60 |
| -1 | Uninitiated | -45 |
| 0 | Beginner | -30 |
| 1 | Novice | -15 |
| 2 | Average | 0 |
| 3 | Intermediate | +15 |
| 4 | Advanced | +30 |
| 5 | Professional | +45 |
| 6+ | Master | +60 |

A task's quality is determined by the average of the scores. For every hour a task takes, roll the dice once, and write down the score. Once time is over, scores are averaged by the number of hours. Time is rounded up to the nearest hour, but this does not affect actual task time. For example, crafting four bolts from wood (10 minutes each) requires four rolls, but only takes forty minutes, where a two hour oil painting takes two rolls and the result of each is added and divided by the two hours for an end result. Tasks can be rushed or taken slowly for quality loss or gain respectively.

| Final score | Quality |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 0 - 10 | Unacceptable |
| 11 - 20 | Shoddy |
| 21 - 40 | Poor |
| 41 - 60 | Barely Acceptable |
| 61 - 70 | Acceptable |
| 71 - 80 | Good |
| 81 - 90 | Very Good |
| 91 - 100 | Great |
| 101 - 140 | Excellent |
| 141+ | Masterwork |

| Haste | Quality Modifier | Time modifier |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------- | 
| Rushed | * 0.75 | * 0.5 |
| Methodical | * 1.25 | * 1.50 |

#### Conversations
In a conversation, sometimes a creature need to convince someone of something. Other times they need to lie.

Using any of the speech skills to manipulate another creature will cause an adversarial speech check.

If the person you are trying to convince is friendly or neutral, they will go along with your words if you beat their judgment roll, also a d100/percentile/2d10 roll. If they are hostile, they get an additional level (+15) to resist your charm/intimidation/knowledge/lies.

#### Damage
Damage can be calculated in one of two ways: Simple and complex.
- Simple: From the initial roll, subtract goal value, add weaknessess and resistances, and thats the damage.
- Complex: Perform the simple calculation, then roll the percentile/2d10s. Divide this value by 100 and multiply by two, then round up to the nearest whole number. This allows for anywhere between 1 damage and double what simple allows for.

### Combat
Combat will happen pretty frequently in most campaigns. Each round of combat lasts ten seconds in universe, and during that time each character in combat has the option of taking some actions during their turn. At the end of their turn, they pick a defensive posture.

#### Turn Order
Turn order is determined by taking the Nimbleness score and adding 1d10 to that score. Ties are solved first by higher Nimbleness score, then a secondary roll of a d10 each if those are equal. The new rolls are only for determining who goes first among conlict, and not resetting their place among the larger group.

#### Actions
During a creature's turn, they have certain actions they can take. These actions are in three categories, Offensive, Movement, Trivial. One of each action is provided at the start of the creature's turn. In addition, free actions are also available during a turn and between other creature's turns.

##### Offensive actions:
These are the main combat options given to most creatures.

- Melee attacks (Brawn based Stat)
- Ranged attacks (Nimbleness based Stat)
- Pushing/pulling/tripping/attempting to move an opponent (Brawn based Stat)
- Breaking free from an opponent currently holding you. (Brawn or Nimbleness Stat)
- Casting most forms of offensive magic. (Light, Dark, or wit Stats as appropriate)
- 10 second Why-you-suck speeches

##### Movement actions:
Based on the creature's speed, they have a certain number of units they can move per turn. Default is 6 units for a medium creature, but this can change. Each movement action uses some amount of units per grid space, listed in the table. Actions that don't move the creature consume the unit cost without moving the creature

| Action | Unit cost |
| ------ | --------- |
| Walking | 1 unit per |
| Flying | 1 unit per |
| Burrowing | 1 unit per |
| Climbing | 2 units per |
| Crawling | 2 Units per |
| Grabbing an item* | 3 units per |
| Kicking away an item | 2 units per |
| Going prone | 1 units per |
| Standing up | 3 units per |
| Loading a bolt into a large crossbow | 3 units per |

*If an item is on the ground or in a hard to reach location such as the floor, a high shelf, or a backpack, it costs some movement units to grab. It its in an easy to grab location, it's Trivial.

##### Trivial actions:
- Withdrawing or replacing an item from a belt, holster, sheath, or waist level pouch.
- Drinking a potion
- Force feeding a potion down an unconcious person's throat
- Loading a bolt into a small crossbow
- Grabbing an arrow or bolt from a quiver
- Paying attention to something (Observation-type checks)
- Pperating a simple mechanism such as a button or lever
- Pithy one-liners

####$ Free actions:
- Dropping a held item
- Changing defensive posture
- Screaming in pain

When casting magic, observe the action required, as some spells use movement or trivial actions rather than a full offensive action.

Actions can be traded down, but not up. One Offensive action can be traded for six more units of movement, and three units of movement can be traded for one Trivial action. However, movement cannot be traded for an additional Offensive action and Trivial actions cannot be traded for additional movement.

Some Offensive actions are considered slow. Slow actions consume some units of movement in addition to the Offensive action.

#### Defensive postures:
There are three defensive postures one can take:

Steady: Allows a unit to make full use of their armor, deflecting incoming attack more readily. Incoming attacks hit against armor value. 

Dodgy: Halves armor value, but allows you to use completely avoid damage the strike misses. Incoming attacks are contested against dodge stat.

Unguarded: When unconscious, falls into this state. Armor value is halved, and dodge is at zero. also automatically goes prone.

### Skill challenges:
When not in combat, but a feat of derring-do or just plain old trying to climb a cliff face or capture a fleeing convict or... basically doing action hero stuff outside of combat. This isn't sitting down and contemplating, this is snap judgment, hurried actions to accomplish a goal.

#### Setup
First, the GM sets a win condition, such as capturing an escaping man. The GM provides a difficulty based on the below chart (this is a general guideline, use whateve values seem appropriate for party skill level):

| Difficulty | Goal     |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Trivial    | 5        |
| Easy       | 10       |
| Novice     | 15       |
| Intermediate | 20     |
| Advanced   | 25       |
| Expert     | 30       |
| Professional | 35     |
| Master     | 40       |
| Impossible | 45       |

Once this value is set (the players don't need to be told it, but it should be written down to forstall cheating acusations), determine player order.

Turn order is determined by taking the Nimbleness score and adding 1d10 to that score. Ties are solved first by higher Nimbleness score, then a secondary roll of a d10 each if those are equal. The new rolls are only for determining who goes first among conflict, and not resetting their place among the larger group.

The player asks to perform a task. This task must use one of their stats or skills in an appropriate manner (no lockpicking a horse or punching through an exam) and must further the group towards acheiving the goal. No going off to the library to read while the bandit gets away.

This is the perfect time to use items and circumstantial things to your advantage. need to rappel down a building? Well, you hav ethose really nice pitons, 100 feet or rope and are really good at tying knots... it's up to the Gm ultimately to accept a reasoning as a bonus value to your role.

The player rolls the dice after all bonuses have been added up, and they check if the player clears the task.

If they do, they continue on with the chase/climb/whatever, but if they fail they have a new obstacle in their way.

### And that's it.
Not much to remember, right? Most interactions are solved through this system, so understanding all of this means you can play without any issues! There's some more math that goes into character creation but that can be worked out before a session.

***Stats & Other values***
-------------------
### Stats
Their are 8 base Stats that influence a characters general abilities. 

The 8 Stats are:
| Stat | Abbreviation | Description | Tomato |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Brawn | Bwn | A value of how much muscle can be directly applied to problems, such as stubborn doors and unruly bandits. | Can toss a tomato *really* far. |
| Nimbleness | Nim | The value of how fast and adept a character is with their hands or claws. Most likely to stand on top of a flagpole. | Can juggles lots of tomatoes. |
| Health | Hea | How durable a creature is, handy when constantly being poisoned or stabbed. Or both. | Can eat rotten tomatoes without getting sick. |
| Charm | Cha | How good a character is at convincing others. Not necessarily attractive, but it sure helps. | Can convince someone to buy tomatoes even if they own a tomato farm. |
| Wit | Wit | How intelligent a character is, handing for knowing exactly which type of magic just almost cut off their head. | Know tomotoes are a fruit |
| Survival | Sur | How good a character is at figuring out thing, like knowing not to eat poison ivy. Or gemstones. | Knows not to put tomatoes in fruit salad. |
| Light Magic | LM | A character's light magic aptitude. Handy for creating floods or firestorms and other natural disasters. | Can grow a tomato in a day. |
| Dark Magic | DM | A characters dark magic aptitude. Useful to have around to settle murder cases, *and* cause them. | Can cause a tomato to rot. |

If picking an average creature, it will have a "0" score in most areas. Note that an average person is "Beginner" at most tasks. This is because an average person is not "average" at a task but near the bottom of the skill curve.

To calculate Stats, there are four methods:
- Unrestricted Dice: Roll 8d6. Subtract 2 from all dice rolls. Assign scores as desired. One tweak is allowed, raising a stat by one point by reducing another by one point. 
- Restricted Dice: For each stat in turn, roll 1d6 and subtract 2. One tweak is allowed, raising a stat by one point by reducing another by one point.
- Standard Allotment: Start with all stats at 0. From a pool of 12 points, asign points according to the following:
  - You can lower a stat below zero. Only one stat can be -2 OR two stats can be -1.
  - The max any score can be is +4
  - Only one +4 can be assigned.
- Standard Array: Use the following values as required: one +4, one +3, two +2â€™s, two 1's, one +0, and a -1.

Note that the average cumulative score for all of this methods is +12. Note that this is pre-racial or -class bonuses, and those will change these stats.

The random dice method should be evaluated by a GM. Anything lower than +8 or 9 or higher than a +15 or +16 may be considered to under- or overpowered. If judged as such, re-roll stats.

### Health
You max health is determined by your race and your Health stat. It grows each time you level up. 

When you are reduced to 0 health, you lose consciousness. If the enemy continues to wail on your unconscious self, you will die once you reach the negative of your max health. 

#### Mundane Healing/Recovery
Mundane methods- medicine, tourniquets and splints- allow you to recover faster than your body would naturally heal. However, most methods take time to take effect. Most mundane medicines take at least a medium rest to take effect.

Naturally, a creature heals up at 25% of their max health value each long rest. 

#### Magical Healing
Unlike Mundane healing, Magical healing is instant and can be used in battle. 

Instead of actually healing someone, some spells add a buffer of extra health called magical health on top of your current health and is drained first when damaged. 

When you get healed by Magical healing, it burns a magical recovery point. if a creature is out of magical recover points, half of the value of healing is subtracted from the target. For example, if a spell does 15 points of healing, but the target has used their recovery points, they lose seven health but gain 15 magical health. It's a next gain, but then after the battle once the spell wears off the creature will be worse off.

Magical health wears off after a short rest. Magical recovery points are restored 1 per Medium rest or 2 per Long rest.

### Size
This is how big an average creature of a species is and how it affects them. For example, Humans can sometimes be taller than 2m, but they're still medium creatures.

Winged creatures gain a size when they unfurl their wings

| Size | Max Size in units | Dodge penalty | Speed Adjustment |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Mini | 0.5m * 0.5m * 0.5m | 0 | +1 |
| Small | 1m * 1m * 1m | -2 | +1 |
| Medium | 2m * 2m * 2m | -4 | 0 |
| Large | 3m * 3m * 3m | -6 | 0 |
| Towering | 4m * 4m * 4m | -8 | -1 |
| Immense | 7m * 7m *7m | -10 | -2 |

### Carry weight
Weight is measured in kg be default. A character can only carry so much before they start to feel all of the equipment they're lugging around.

***Skills***
------------
Skills are the broad categories of actions that a character can perform. Skills are areas of life one can specialize in.

Sometimes a different stat may be used for a skill, usually because of a perk of a class.

***Schools of Magic***
----------------------
Magic allows someone to do great feats even without working out daily. There are three schools of magic containing five sub-schools each.

Magical stamina is how many spells can be fired off before resting. Additional spells can be cast, but once the magical stamina is exhausted, casting a spell takes away a hit point per tier of spell. Magical stamina replenishes at a rate of 1 point every short rest.

Instead of magical stamina, 1 magical component can be used. This component is consumed.

Magical stamina / component consumption rate is based on tier of magic.

### Light Magic 
Light magic is the study of the basic forces. Elemental magics Air, Earth, Water, Health and Nature. These are cleansing forces, the ones rumored to create the world and all it's splendor by the gods.

| Magic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Air | Harnesses the very air around the target to create attacks from unpredicatable directions |
| Earth | Uses the ground to form armor of rock and create walls to manage crowds |
| Health | Magical healing. Very useful, highly respected |
| Nature | Working with plants, using magic to encourage growth and to strangle foes |
| Water | Create a tidal wave in the desert and crash your way through enemies |

### Dark Magic
Dark magic is the study of the complex forces. Elemental magics Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrosis and Resurrection. These are the destructive forces, the one rumored to have been created by the old ones to fight the gods.

| Magic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Cold | As filled with ice as the glare you got from you rparents for picking this school |
| Fire | Leave a burnt trail in your wake |
| Lightning | If they touch you, they'll regret it |
| Necrosis | Lords of decay|
| Resurrection | Bringing people back from the dead |

### Book magic
Book magic is the study of reality and how to tweak it. The magics of Biology, Enchanting, Force, Illusions and Spacial. These are invented by sapient people purely to make their lives better.

| Magic | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Biology | Not technically magic, but try telling the peasants that |
| Enchanting | Making magic items from mundane items, brewing potions |
| Force | Direct application of magic to form walls and blades |
| Illusion | Fooling the senses of others for fun and profit |
| Spatial | Controling a small amount of space as if you are the god of that area. |

***Character Creation***
------------------------
To create a character, there are several things that need to be considered.

On the mechanical side, A characters race, stats and class define a lot about the character. Do they spend time learning to heal people by reading books or do they charge recklessly into battle with knife, dancing around enemies? Species more accepted by the others are less likely to get picked on. Necromancers are reviles near universally, so why did you character go down that path? Starting from the mechanics allows for a lot of cool options, planning a characters progression and a backstory to fit why they went down the path of a spellsword instead of a standard fighter.

On the roleplay side, Your character needs a name, a general attitude, how old they are, their ideals. A young woman out to fight dragons? A grizzled man who just wanted to retire to the woods? If you pick to distribute your stats via the restricted dice method, is your character happy with their strength or do they stubbornly insist on being a wizard despite their lack of aptitude for it? Consider asking your GM if there's races the they would prefer you be, for ease of insertion into the story of because they would be a unique inclusion in the story, like a werewolf among a plague of werewolves.

1. To start doing the math, make sure your stats, Class, and Race are picked out and move to the next step. The equations are gathered at the end of the document.
2. Write down the stats of your character, assigned as per one of the methods above.
3. From the race page, find racial bonuses and add them to the Stats. Grab the base speed, base health, and size from the race of choice. Any traits also given should be marked down.
4. From the class page, take all of the perks for the specified class and write them down with their effects. Write down all of the given equipment, gold and training you get by default.
5. Now that most of the default bonuses are assigned, choose the last two items you would like to train in. Write down all of the calculated skills down.
6. From the stats, determine maximum health, maximum magical stamina, maximum magical recovery and maximum carry weight.
7. If desired, weapons, armor and gear may be purchased during character creation. It is advised to do it here for the next step.
8. Calculate the armor value of any armor worn. Calculate the dodge value. Calculate speed.
9. For each weapon, calculate how many dice will be thrown if no circumstantial bonuses are needed for quick reference later.
10. For magical characters, select spells as granted by perks.

From here, the character is mechanically ready, but some more work may need to be done to fully flesh them out as a character. Write down physical features, preferences, backstory, etc. to make the character truly unique.

***Leveling:***
---------------
Experience is earned in combat, by completing quests, by winning skill challenges, and by talking to NPCs
When enough experience is earned, a level is gained.

| Level   | Experience   | Total Experience   | Perks:
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------ | -----------------------------------
| 1       | 0            | 0                  | Class, Race, 2 training

***Definitions***
-----------------
#### Critical failure
A complete failure, resulting in an unfavorable outcome such as miss-aiming a weapon at a friendly, breaking the a lever to open a door, or doing signifcant damage to oneself. Up to the GM.

#### Friendly, neutral, hostile
Creatures can be friendly, neutral or hostile towards each other. There are shade of each, so don't expect all friends to be equal or all enemies to be equal either.
- Friendly: Willing to cooperate towards a mutual goal and usually within reason are willing to provide some backup for the others' goals.
- Neutral: Willing to cooperate towards a mutual goal, but will not go out of their way to assist the other party.
- Hostile: Will not cooperate.

#### Food
Food can be filling, satiating, or mediocre.
- Filling (5 gold, 2 lbs): Creature does not need to eat for 8 hours of rigorous activity or 12 hours of low level activity
- Satiating (2 gold, 1 lb): Creature does not need to eat for 4 hours of rigorous activity or 6 hours of low level activity
- Mediocre (1 gold, 1/2 lb): Creature does not need to eat for 2 hours of rigorous activity or 3 hours of low level activity

#### Game Master (GM)
A Game Master (GM) is the person or system running the world the players interact with. They are the ultimate authority on what is and isn't allowed in the game, so make sure to understand how each GM handles their games.

#### Item ranges
Items have specific ranges they can be used at effectively. A melee wepon must be used on an adjecent tile unless it has reach on it, allowing for a one tile gap btween the user of the item and their target. A ranged weapon can be used effectively out to it's maximum range value, and past that the user suffers a 2 die penalty to hit their target.

#### Resistances/weaknesses
Modifiers that affect how much dmage can be dealt. A resistance reduces incoming damage of a type, and a weakness increases damage of that type. Immunity is considered a resistance of infinity. 

Types:
- Armor piercing: Negates amount of armor equal to value. Does nothing against unarmored targets.
- Blunt: Blunt weapons. ANything that doesn't hold an edge.
- Fire: Heat and direct flame exposure. Non magical explosions fall into this category.
- Ice: Cold and direct ice exposure.
- Necrotic: Literal life draining, advancing diseases and attacking already made wounds.
- Piercing: Weapons with a sharp edge
- Water: Water attacks, exposure to water.

#### Resting & exhaustion
There are three levels of resting. Longer rests also gain the benefits and drawbacks of smaller rests. You take around six short rests during a medium rest after all.
- Short rest: About half an hour with no major activity going on. No fighting, climbing, walking etc. Magical healing fades over this amount of time. Combat skills that are "once-per-battle" are refreshed.
- Medium rest: About three hours, no major activity going on. After a medium rest, mundane healing takes effect and a magical recovery point is recovered.
- Long rest: Six hours of sleep or species' required equivalent, only interrupted for at most two hours to be on guard duty. Two recovery points are restored during this time from the two contained medium rests.

Once taken a long rest, it takes 14 hours before a creature gets tired again through normal means. 

Exhaustion is caused when a creatures hasn't been able to rest for a while. Exertion of all types exacerbates this. Resting removes exhaustion.
| Exhaustion level | Name | Penalties |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- |
| 0 | Default | No penalty |
| 1 | Tired | Stats are temporarily reduced by 1 |
| 2 | Dead Tired | Movement speed is halved |
| 3 | Exhausted | any d6 roll uses half as many d6 |
| 4 | Shattered | Will fall unconscious spontaneously if not kept awake |
| 5 | Tormented | Senses shut down, can no longer move |
| 6 | Death | Creature dies |

#### Shaped attacks
Some attacks are area of effect, and have a shape.

Rectangle attacks fill a certain number of units at a time, for specified width, depth and height

Conical attacks have a point of origin, a direction, and a distance. anything within the cone is affected. Angle of cone is 30 degrees unless otherwise specified.

#### Training
Training gives a bonus to a skill or can grant more dice to use with a weapon. Being trained in something means that the character understands a lot about the subject on some level and can put that knowledge to good use.

For training for anything that uses d6s (weapons, climbing, some tools, etc) being trained adds 2d6 to the combined roll. Obviously, this means you are that much more likely to make the leap across the gap - you've been trained to. If the training is for a skill, the skill rank is moved up by 1.

Training cannot be added on top of each other.

#### Unit
a unit is a 2m * 2m * 2m cube.

#### Dodge
(base dodge (20) - size penalty - armor penalty - (weight penalty/2 rounded down) + (Nim bonus * 2))

#### Magic Stamina
(LM * 3) Or (DM * 3) Or (Wit * 3), whichever is highest.

#### Maximum Health
level 1: Race base health + (3 * Hea(min 0)).

### Maximum Carry Weight
(base weight (30) + (10 * Brawn)) or 5 + sum of bag carrying caps, whichever is lower.

#### Quality of task
(Total of all rolls / hours to complete task) * Haste modifier. Time is rounded up to the next whole hour.

#### Magical Recovery points
Hea stat + 2. Gain an additional point every five levels.

#### Skill values
