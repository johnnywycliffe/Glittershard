***Traits:***
-------------
### Breath Weapon
Uses 1 Magical stamina to use. There are six types: Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Earth, Cold and Water. Cone shaped, starts in unit in front of dragonkin. Travels 10 feet. Damage roll is  (3 + Sur)d6

### Bullrush 
As a trivial action, burn 3 hit points and add six units of movement during this turn.

### Cursed
Unable to use Light Magic

### Enhanced Senses
Enhanced senses are better than "human standard" senses, and creatures with it get an extra 2d6 when searching using their senses.

### Flying
Flying allows an entity to maneuver over obstacles. One must be able to move to fly. Anything that restricts movement will cause a flying entity to stop moving and fall. Maximum height is twice movement speed of the entity. Grants +5 to dodge.

### Gifted
Can assign a bonus +1 to any Stat when this trait is assigned.

### Natural Backpack
Creatures that have ample storage inside their bodies gain an extra backpack's worth of space.

### Natural Weapons
Lots of creatures have natural weapons. It's considered a trained natural weapon if it can effectively be used in battle by that creature. This means a wolf will have a trained bite, where a human will not. 

| Weapon | Added Dice | Damage | Damage Type | Bonus effect |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Bite -  Normal | 0d6 | 4 | Bladed | - |
| Bite - Vampire | 0d6 | 6 | Bladed | Allows vampire to feed |
| Bite - Poisoned | 0d6 | 4 | Bladed | Attempts to poison target |
| Claw | 1d6 | 6 | Bladed | - |
| Grab | 1d6 | 2 | Blunt | Binds target |
| Kick | 1d6 | 6 | Blunt | - |
| Punch | 1d6 | 6 | Blunt | - |

### Nightvision
Able to see in poor lighting conditions, such as moonlight and starlight.

### Poor senses
Unless in a favorable environment, sensory range is speed range. Favorable environments are water for naiads, forests for dryads, 

### Pure
Unaffected by Vampirism, Waere, Zombie infection, 

### Shapeshifter
The ability to change shape. If an entity can shapeshift, it gains a +1 to deception checks if target is unaware of the entity’s ability to shapeshift. Shapeshifts do not change the size of entities.

### Subrace
If a Primary race (Vampire, Waere, Zombie, etc) has the subrace trait, that means it has another race under the primary race. For example, a werewolf can be a human or an Minotaur. Subraces cannot be stacked, no werewolf vampires. Pure species cannot be used with subraces. Cannot be a subrace in the same category, so no Cursed One Satyrs, and no Zombie Wights.

Creatures use Subrace's size and keep Flying and natural weapons. Otherwise, they are written over by the primary race.

### Subrace (Animal)
Uses the form of an animal. Keeps all natural weapons of that species. Species size determines what Stat bonuses and traits apply.

### Tainted by Light
Unable to use Dark Magic. Pure.

### Vampirism (Race)
Vampires need to suck blood from a natural or fey creature every 24 hours. Appears as a member of it's subrace aside from a lightened complexion and pointier teeth. These teeth confer a trained bite-vampire attack.

The longer a vampire goes without feeding, certain syptoms start to show up. Vampires cannot be satiated by normal food.
| Days without feeding | Effect | Feeds to reduce level |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| 0-1 | None | 0 |
| 2-3 | -1 to Cha, -1 to DM | 1 |
| 4-8 | -2 to Cha, -2 to DM, starts to shake (People notice something is wrong) | 2 |
| 9+ | Will not be able to resist the attempt to feed. May accidentally drain prey completely. | 3 |

Each feeding removes 5 hit points from target. Each time they feed, subtract on from the times the vampire needs to feed to reduce level. E.G. A vampire that didn't eat for 5 days, Needs to eat twice to go back to the second level and three days to return to perfect form.

If panic feeding (9+ days) roll d10s with Wit bonus. If succeeds, managed to stop themselves after three feedings. Failure means they drain their target.

If creature is bit by a vampire, not Pure and the vampirism is not removed within a week, creature becomes a vampire. If one target is drained three days in a row without treatment, that creature becomes a zombie. 

### Waere
Can transform into a beast form once per day, and stays in this form until creature takes a medium rest. This beast form resembles an animal like a bear, wolf, boar, or other medium sized mammal but Large and sapient. When in subrace form, Stats are halved.

In Waere form, cannot wield tools. Instead, grows claws.

Every day that a Waere doesn't transform increases the liklyhood of transforming spontaneously. Every time the creature goes to sleep or falls unconscious, roll to see if transforms. If wakes up in this state, will attempt to fight anyone within melee range or that is blocking their escape path.

(Number of days - 1) * 5. Roll d10s and succeed if beating 

### Unsleeping
Does not suffer Exhaustion from non-magical means. Instead 2 hours must be spent meditating to gain long rest benefits. This cannot occur more than once every 20 hours.
